    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    <i>fresfolio</i> stands for "<b>F</b>or <b>Res</b>earch <b>Folio</b>". It is a browser-based note-taking app designed to help researchers organize and track their projects, datasets, analyses, and results in a structured format. Although the name emphasizes â€œresearch", <i>fresfolio</i> is equally suitable for personal use, allowing individuals to manage hobby and student projects, or any collection of work in an organized and interactive way. It provides tools for creating rich documentation making it easier to share findings with collaborators.
